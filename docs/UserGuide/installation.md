# Installation

The library can be installed like any other regular library. The only constraint here is to have the hexamind repository cloned on your local machine. In a future release, we will deploy the library on a private registry. 

## Clone the private github repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HexamindOrganisation/hexamind.git
```

You must have access to the repository to clone it. If you don't, please contact the repository owner.

## Install the library using pip

```bash
pip install -e path/to/hexamind
```
